In order to use this extension, on Chrome go to the extensions page through settings and enable "developer mode"(top of page). Then click on "Load Unpacked Extension..."

Check the box that says "Enable" to enable the extension, and on the top right corner you should see the extension with a red "Reddit" icon.

Click on the icon and you will see a small popup open. The default on the drop down menu is "All Categories". Choose whichever category you want and hit "Start".
This will start the process of notifying you every minute a new post is found.

The "Clear All Notifications" also functions as a chrome extension reload. Use it if the extension is not working properly.
